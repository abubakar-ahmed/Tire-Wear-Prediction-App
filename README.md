## **Tire-Wear-Prediction-App**

Welcome to the **Tire Wear Predictor**, a machine learning-powered solution that predicts tire wear percentage based on key driving conditions such as tire compound, track surface, and more. The project leverages a trained regression model served via a FastAPI endpoint and integrates seamlessly with a Flutter-based mobile app for user interaction.
